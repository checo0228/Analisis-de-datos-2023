      "ASTRO 25 is the next generation of ASTRO digital two-way radio communications by Motorola Solutions.  Motorola first introduced digital two-way radio in the U.S. in 1991 under the name ASTRO Digital Solutions.With the completion of the APCO Project 25 standard, Motorola introduced the ASTRO 25 solution and migrated its ASTRO Digital Solutions customers to ASTRO 25. Project 25 (also known as P25) is a suite of standards for digital radio communications that is designed specifically for law enforcement, fire and medical services to communicate with each other during emergency situations.ASTRO 25 is now the most widely used P25 mission critical voice and data communication network in the world. It is designed to provide reliable and always available communication for public safety agencies.The Original ASTRO 25 format utilizes APCO Project 25 Phase I technology (FDMA). It is the most used format of the ASTRO 25 family of radio systems.\n",
      "The ASTRO 25  Phase II system, which complies with the P25 Phase II standard, uses TDMA technology to deliver both voice and data messaging over a single wireless communications infrastructure. Because ASTRO 25 Phase II is a P25 TDMA system, it offers greater spectrum efficiency, lower equipment costs, advanced radio features and flexibility, and longer battery life. The ASTRO 25 network also ensures encryption key assignment over the system's radio channels and enhanced network security tools.The ASTRO 25 digital radio system is claimed to provide superior audio quality and advanced features which comply with the Federal Communications Commission's narrowbanding requirements. ASTRO 25 currently operates in the 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, UHF and VHF bands for voice and data operation.\n",

      "\"Man or Astro-man?\" is an American surf rock group that was formed in Auburn, Alabama in the early 1990s and came to prominence over the following decade.\n",
      "Primarily instrumental, \"Man or Astro-man?\" blended the surf rock style of the early 1960s, like that of Dick Dale and The Spotnicks with the new wave and punk rock sounds of the late 1970s and early 1980s. \"Man or Astro-man?\" was known for their anachronistic dedication to science fiction themes, audio samples, obscure electronic devices (such as theremins and tesla coils), and high-energy live performances. Their earlier albums like Is It ... Man or Astroman? and Destroy All Astromen! were known for their traditional surf rock instrumentation and sci-fi sound bite song introductions, whereas their later albums like EEVIAC... and A Spectrum of Infinite Scale were known for their use of synthesizers, printers (like the Apple ImageWriter II), and their more abstract, experimental sound. Their recordings were often peppered with sound bites from obscure science fiction films and TV shows.\n",
      "It is largely believed that the group took its name from the poster of the U.S. release of the Japanese film The Human Vapor, which includes the tagline \"IS HE MAN OR ASTRO-MAN?\", the line seemingly appropriated as the title of their first album, Is It ... Man or Astroman?.\n",

      "The Houston Astros are an American professional baseball team based in Houston, Texas. The Astros compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) West division, having moved to the division in 2013 after spending their first 51 seasons in the National League (NL).The Astros were established as the Houston Colt .45s and entered the National League as an expansion team in 1962 along with the New York Mets. The current name, reflecting Houston's role as the host of the Johnson Space Center, was adopted three years later, when they moved into the Astrodome, the first domed sports stadium and the so-called \"Eighth Wonder of the World.\" The Astros moved to a new stadium called Minute Maid Park in 2000. The Astros played in the NL West division from 1969 to 1993, then the NL Central division from 1994 to 2012, before being moved to the AL West as part of an MLB realignment in 2013.\n",
      "The Astros posted their first winning record in 1972 and made the playoffs for the first time in 1980, and they won three division titles in the 1980s. Spearheaded by the Killer B's, a collection of prominent hitters that included the Astros' only Hall of Fame members Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell, the Astros began reaching major prominence in the late 1990s and early 2000s with four further division titles and two Wild Card appearances, culminating in their first World Series appearance in 2005 where they were swept by the AL’s Chicago White Sox. After a major slump throughout the next decade, the team was purchased by business owner Jim Crane in 2011 for $680 million. Under Crane's ownership, the Astros embraced sabermetrics and pioneered new analytical technologies in their transition to the American League, and by the mid-2010s has transformed from a poor franchise into one of MLB's most dominant and successful clubs. Since then, the Astros have won over 100 games in four seasons, appeared in a record six consecutive American League Championship Series, and won four of the last six American League pennants. During this time, the Astros won the 2017 World Series, their first championship, against the Los Angeles Dodgers; they made later appearances in 2019 against the Washington Nationals, 2021 against the Atlanta Braves, and 2022 against the Philadelphia Phillies, winning their second title in the latter series. They are the only team to win a postseason series in six straight seasons. Their fifth pennant in 2022 made them the second team created in the expansion era to win five league pennants (after the Mets), and they are the fifth expansion team to have won two World championships.\n",
      "During the 2019–2020 off-season, the Astros became the prime suspect in an MLB-wide sign stealing scandal that took place during the 2017 and 2018 seasons, resulting in the suspensions of manager A. J. Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow, with Crane later firing both. The Astros' roles in the scandal, as well as what were believed to be minimal punishments for its players, have caused the Astros to become one of the most maligned baseball teams in the modern age. Despite this, many have noted the Astros' continued success, and they are widely seen as the most dominant team in the American League today.From 1962 through the end of the 2022 season, the Astros' all-time record is 4,831-4,820 (.501). In addition to having the most postseason appearances by an expansion team, they are the only expansion era team with an all-time winning record.\n",

      "Astro Boy (アストロボーイ・鉄腕アトム, Asutoro Bōi: Tetsuwan Atomu, lit. \"Astro Boy: Mighty Atom\") is a remake from the 1963 anime series of the same name created by Osamu Tezuka. Produced by Tezuka Productions, Sony Pictures Entertainment Japan, Animax, Dentsu, and Fuji TV, it was directed by Kazuya Konaka, with Marc Handler as the story editor, Shinji Seya designing the characters, Shinji Aramaki and Takeshi Takakura designing the mechanical elements, Keiichirō Mochizuki serving as chief animation director, and Takashi Yoshimatsu composing the music. The anime was created to celebrate the birthdate of Atom/Astro Boy, as well as the 40th anniversary of the original TV series. It kept the same classic art style as the original manga and anime, but was renewed and modernized with more lush, high-quality, near-theatrical animation and visuals, combining the playfulness of the early anime with the darker, more serious and dramatic science fiction themes of the manga and the 1980 series. The anime was broadcast in Japan on Fuji TV from April 6, 2003, to March 28, 2004, every Sunday from 9:30 to 10:00 JST, for a total of 50 episodes, and it was also aired outside of Japan on Kids' WB in the United States and other local broadcasters overseas.\n",
